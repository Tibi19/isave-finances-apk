# iSave
iSave is an android application for tracking your finances.

It uses the _**budget organizer**_, a feature that is psychologically designed to help you take better decisions and motivate you to save more. The budget organizer breaks up your overall budget into smaller, bite-sized budgets. Just like your budget is over a set period of time, it is divided over smaller intervals of time.

iSave is also flexible enough to adapt to your needs. All payments can be saved into _**categories**_. You can choose whether you want each payment to count up to your budget, or if you just want to separate it into a specific category. This also offers an overview into your spendings. A full list of all your payments can be exported as a csv file for in depth analysis.

A category that exceeds its budget will be helped by the other categories. These will lend from their own budgets to the category that needs help. This is done proportionally to the size of their budgets. This feature can be disabled by unticking the "flexible" box of a category. Organizer intervals are flexible by default, but will only help chronologically. E.g. if interval 2 exceeds its budget, only intervals 3, 4, and so on, will help.
